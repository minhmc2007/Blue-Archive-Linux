## Project Overview

Blue Archive Linux provides a "Schale-inspired" workstation experience. It combines the rolling-release nature of Arch Linux with a heavily customized KDE Plasma environment. The project focuses on visual consistency, high-performance animations, and a clean user interface.

### Key Features

*   **Arch Linux Base:** Reliable, lightweight, and always up-to-date.
*   **Custom KDE Plasma:** A bespoke desktop environment featuring custom icon sets, color schemes, and layout configurations.
*   **Dart-Powered Utilities:** Built-in system tools designed with Dart/Flutter for high-fidelity animations and a premium feel.

---

## Custom Applications

This distribution includes two proprietary tools that serve as the interface between the user and the system. Both are built using Dart to ensure smooth, hardware-accelerated UI transitions:

*   **BAL Welcome:** A first-boot utility that guides you through system initialization and basic configuration.
*   **BAL Helper:** A specialized management tool for quick system adjustments and thematic settings.

### Development Documentation
